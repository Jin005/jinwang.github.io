## PhD studentships

I have funding for up to two PhD students to join my new research group in the Department of Mathematics at City, University of London.

The students will pursue projects aligned with my [research themes](research.md) as part of the international [Arizona Cancer Evolution Center (ACE)](http://cancer-insights.asu.edu), which unites cancer evolution experts in London, the US, Switzerland and elsewhere.

I'm looking for students who have (or will soon have) a good honours degree in mathematics, physics, computational biology or another scientific discipline that has equipped them with strong analytical skills, and who are enthusiastic about applying those skills to answering important biological and clinical questions. Demonstrated mathematical modelling capability, relevant biological knowledge, and programming experience (e.g. in C, Python or Matlab) are highly desirable.

Funding includes a stipend for three years (Â£16,000 in 2020/21), the full tuition fee for UK/EU students, a computer, and support for travelling to conferences. International applicants are encouraged to apply and should mention whether they have means to cover the difference between the international and UK/EU tuition fee. Funding for one studentship is fully secured. The second studentship may be awarded subject to within-department competition.

Interested candidates should email me a cover letter (one page), CV, transcripts, and the names of two references.

The positions will remain available until filled, with an initial application deadline of 5th June 2020.

The preferred starting date is October 2020.
