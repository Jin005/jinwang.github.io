## PhD studentships

I have funding for two PhD students to join my new research group in the Department of Mathematics at City, University of London.

These students will pursue projects aligned with my [research themes](research.md) as part of the international [Arizona Cancer Evolution Center (ACE)](http://cancer-insights.asu.edu), which unites cancer evolution experts in London, the US, Switzerland and elsewhere.

I'm looking for students who have (or will soon have) a good honours degree in mathematics, physics, computational biology or another scientific discipline that has equipped them with strong analytical skills. Demonstrated mathematical modelling capability, relevant biological knowledge and programming experience are highly desirable.

Interested candidates should email me a cover letter (one page), CV, transcripts, and the names of two references.

The positions will remain available until filled, with an initial application deadline of 5th May 2020.

The preferred starting date is October 2020.

This page will be updated with further details (last update 20th May).
