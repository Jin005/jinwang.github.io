I use mathematical and computational models to investigate the evolution and ecology of cancer, in collaboration with experimental biologists and clinicians.

I'm interested in the evolution and ecology of cancer risk; characterising and forecastingÂ tumor evolution; evolutionary approaches to suppressing drug resistance; and personalised cancer therapy.

My methods include agent-based models, analysis of dynamic systems, matrix population models, and Bayesian data analysis.

I created and maintain the ggmuller R package [ggmuller](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggmuller) for plotting evolutionary dynamics and the [demon](https://github.com/robjohnnoble/demon_model) tumour evolution simulator.
